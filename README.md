Measurement Instruments 
This Study employed a multi-faceted validation approach to ensure the robustness and relevance of our research instruments. First, this Study ascertained the Face Validity, assessing whether, at a preliminary glance, our measures aptly captured the intended constructs. This Study meticulously crafted Content Validity; our instruments probe the relationships among customer pressure, stakeholder pressure, Government Initiatives, LTAT, CEPI, new BMI, and the multidimensional performance metrics—social, economic, environmental, and organizational—of SMEs in Ethiopia. This process emphasized the significance of the Ethiopian local context, ensuring that our questions were theoretically sound and culturally relevant.
With Criterion Validity, this Study endeavored to harmonize our questions with existing measures or scales present in literature, specifically those concerning Market Uncertainties, Stakeholder Pressure, Government Initiatives, CEPI, LTAT, BMI, and the encompassing performance parameters of SMEs. The final validation layer, Construct Validity, saw our questions anchored in a theoretical framework that amalgamated the Resource-based Theory, Industry-based Theory, Institutional-based Theory, and Stakeholder Theory. The interplay was especially pertinent in understanding and measuring perceptions of CEPI, LTAT, and BMI.
To reinforce the credibility of our instruments, this Study meticulously reviewed pertinent literature. This Study appropriately cited each source in the manuscript, ensuring a seamless melding of existing knowledge and our research endeavors.
In the research, measurement instruments were meticulously adapted from established literature and underwent rigorous validation processes encompassing Face Validity, Content Validity, Criterion Validity, and Construct Validity. The construct of Customer Pressure was primarily influenced by the work of Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022). Meanwhile, Stakeholder Pressure was sourced from the insights of Jabbour et al. (2020) and Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022). The construct concerning Government Initiatives was cultivated from studies by Rehman et al. (2022) and Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022). The research also delved into Locally Tailored Appropriate Technology (LTAT), drawing inspiration from Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022). The Circular Economy Practices Implementation (CEPI) was a synthesis of knowledge from Chiappetta Jabbour et al. (2020), Rehman et al. (2022), and Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022). In the realm of Business Model Innovation (BMI), the guiding literature was Rehman et al. (2022) and Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022). Furthermore, performance metrics such as Social, Economic, Environmental, and Organizational Performance were all grounded in the comprehensive insights from Chiappetta Jabbour et al. (2020), Rehman et al. (2022), and Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022). It is imperative to note that all these constructs were not merely theoretical derivations; they were also validated and confirmed by domain experts, ensuring the robustness of the research framework. The following Table 18 summarizes the adaption of the measurement instruments.
